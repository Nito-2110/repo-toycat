            <h1>How long do shipments take?</h1>
            <p>We usually ship an item <strong> 2 - 3 weeks </strong> after the order has been placed.</p>
            <p>After shipping, delivery usually takes about 2 weeks depending on your location, all of our items ship from the UK.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet">
            <h1>Do you ship internationally? / How can I track my order?</h1>
            <p>We ship to all countries available in DHL! </p> 
            <p>Whenever you place an order, a receipt with a tracking number will be sent to the e-mail you put your order to! Follow the instructions
                from DHL in your browser of preference!

        <div class="bullet">
            <h1>Can I change or cancel my order after placing it?</h1>
            <p>We totally get it — sometimes you hit "buy" a little too fast! While we can’t guarantee changes after the order’s placed (our team moves quick!), shoot us an email <em>as soon as possible</em> and we’ll do our best to help before it ships out.</p>

            <h1>What is your return policy?</h1>
            <p>If something’s not quite right, no worries! We accept returns within 30 days of delivery — as long as the item is unworn, unwashed, and still in its original condition. Just reach out to our support team and they’ll guide you through the process.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bullet">

          <div class="bullet">
            <h1>What sizes are available?</h1>
            <p>Most items come in sizes XS through 3XL (sometimes even more)! You can check the product page for a size chart to find your perfect fit. If you’re between sizes, we usually suggest sizing up for that cozy feel.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bullet">
            <h1>Will the design fade or peel after washing?</h1>
            <p>Nope! As long as you follow the care instructions (like cold wash, inside out, low heat drying), your design should stay looking fresh for the long haul. We use high-quality printing made to last.</p>
